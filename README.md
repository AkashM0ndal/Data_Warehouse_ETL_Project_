# Build_A_Data_Warehouse_ETL_Pipeline

This repository contains a **SQL-based ETL pipeline** that processes raw data into **clean, optimized, and analytics-ready datasets** using a **multi-layered (Bronze / Silver / Gold) architecture**.

- ✅ Handles **60,000+ records**
- ✅ Works across **6+ relational tables**
- ✅ Uses **Schemas, Stored Procedures, and CTEs**
- ✅ Designed for **scalable analytics and reporting**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

1. **Ingest** raw data into the database (Bronze layer).  
2. **Clean, transform, and standardize** data (Silver layer).  
3. **Model optimized tables for reporting and analysis** (Gold Layer).

This architecture follows modern data engineering best practices, ensuring maintainability, traceability, and performance.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture: Bronze / Silver / Gold

The pipeline uses three logical schemas:

- **`bronze schema`** – Raw or minimally processed data.
- **`silver schema`** – Clean, standardized, relational data.
- **`gold schema`** – Business-ready analytical datasets.

## **📂 Schema & Table Design**
## 🥉 Bronze Schema (bronze)

Raw ingestion layer; preserves original structure.

Examples:

- **`bronze.crm_cust_info`**

- **`bronze.crm_prd_info`**

- **`bronze.crm_sales_details`**

- **`bronze.erp_cust_az12`**

- **`bronze.erp_loc_a101`**

- **`bronze.erp_px_cat_g1v2`**


## Characteristics:
- Load all data into table format

- Minimal transformations

- Load timestamps.

- Source-of-truth for auditing

## **🥈 Silver Schema (silver)**

Cleaned, standardized, Optimizing, relational-modeled layer.

## Examples:

- **`silver.crm_cust_info_s`**

- **`silver.crm_prd_info`** 

- **`silver.crm_sales_info`**

- **`silver.erp_cust_az12`**

- **`silver.erp_loc_a101`**

- **`silver.erp_px_cat_g1v1`**

## **Characteristics:**

- Deduplication

- Fix NULLs & data types

- Referential integrity

- Uniform date/time formats

- Validating the numeric columns

## **🥇 Gold Schema (gold)**

Analytics-ready tables(store procedure) for BI and reporting for furthur analysis.

# Examples:

- **`gold.dim_customers`**

- **`gold.dim_products`**

- **`gold.fact_sales`**

## Characteristics:

- Fact/dimension modeling

- Denormalized for performance

- Optimized for dashboard queries


## **⚙️ ETL Logic (Stored Procedures + CTEs)**

This project uses Stored Procedures to orchestrate ETL and CTEs to prepare consistent transformations and VIEWs for retrive only the for data privacy.

## Example Transformation Procedure
####
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE silver.sp_transform_orders
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON

    WITH cleaned_orders AS (
        SELECT
            CAST(order_id AS INT) AS order_id,
            CAST(customer_id AS INT) AS customer_id,
            CAST(order_date AS DATE) AS order_date,
            CAST(product_id AS INT) AS product_id,
            CAST(quantity AS INT) AS quantity,
            CAST(total_amount AS DECIMAL(18,2)) AS total_amount,
            load_ts
        FROM bronze.orders_raw
        WHERE order_id IS NOT NULL
    ),
    deduped_orders AS (
        SELECT *,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY order_id ORDER BY load_ts DESC) AS rn
        FROM cleaned_orders
    )

    INSERT INTO silver.orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, product_id, quantity, total_amount, load_ts)
    SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_date, product_id, quantity, total_amount, load_ts
    FROM deduped_orders
    WHERE rn = 1
END;
GO

## **🔄 ETL Workflow**
## 1️⃣ Create Schemas
####
- CREATE SCHEMA bronze;
- CREATE SCHEMA silver;
- CREATE SCHEMA gold;

## 2️⃣ Load Data → Bronze Layer
####
Raw CSV/external tables loaded directly into `bronze.*_raw`.

## 3️⃣ Transform → Silver Layer
####
EXEC silver.sp_transform_bronze_to_silver;

## 📊 Example Query (Gold Layer)
####
SELECT
    ds.store_name,
    dp.product_name,
    fs.sales_date,
    fs.quantity,
    fs.total_sales
FROM gold.fact_sales fs
JOIN gold.dim_store ds ON fs.store_key = ds.store_key
JOIN gold.dim_product dp ON fs.product_key = dp.product_key;
